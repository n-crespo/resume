Designed a domain-specific language embedding to model and test Detect-and-Avoid systems on autonomous aircraft. Created and formally verified a novel technique for assuring the safety of safety-critical Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) by evaluating if untrusted or AI/ML generated flight instructions would violate predefined operational boundaries. Developed an automated proof strategy for guaranteeing flight safety and correctness, reducing verification time by >90%.

Engineered and integrated lab-wide inventory location tracking with session-persistent cookies into Jefferson Lab's (JLab) data management system to fully automate manual reporting procedures for 200+ lab engineers and improve data quality. Developed a unified fuzzy data searching system by consolidating JLab's cross-departmental relational Oracle SQL databases, reducing data retrieval time by >70% and improving search accuracy and efficiency across all lab departments.

Developed a productive conflict avoidance and recovery system for autonomous UAS in crowded airspaces. Formally verified the safety of this system as a fallback for untrusted ML/AI based controllers in safety-critical situations.
